                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Callam, a softwere engineer from Manchester.
                    I'm currently studying at Codecademy as part of the 
                    IT Career switch programme. But I am much more than 
                    a softwear developer in training; since a young age 
                    I have competed in martial arts, representing my 
                    county and country at home and abroad. I played 
                    rugby union on the Lancashire county team for 3 years.
                    Wanting to share the opportunities I've had I set out to achieve
                    a level 3 qualification in Personal Training. Becoming
                    a private coach before organising and running a brand
                    new programme within a well known gym. This programme
                    took complete beginners and introduced them into the
                    world of combat sports with the opportunity to comete at the end.
